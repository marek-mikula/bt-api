            "description": "## What is Jurat Coin (JTC)?\n\nJurat Coin, or JTC, is a Bitcoin fork blockchain focused on consumer protection and property rights. JTC offers users the unique ability to recover their assets if they are victimized by a hack, fraud, or lose their private keys. The blockchain also provides access to the legal system in the event of a business dispute, making it attractive to those looking to adopt blockchain payment rails. \n \nJTC’s unique features are made possible by a proprietary technology called “Jurat.”  With  Jurat, blockchain nodes can access and enforce court orders directly on-chain without any human intermediary, not even an attorney. For instance, if a judge determines that JTC coins were stolen by a hacker the nodes will understand the court’s order and can return the coins. Effective access to courts reduces the risks of owning digital assets, unlocking the asset’s true value. \n\n\nTokenization is another standout capability for JTC. Digital tokens on the JTC blockchain possess the same on-chain enforcement capabilities as JTC. This opens exciting new possibilities for tokens, such as artists using JTC ordinals to mint their works and collect royalties. If the royalties are not paid, the nodes will follow a court order regarding the artist’s claims. This unique feature also solves a significant challenge for tokenizing real-world assets: maintaining consistency of ownership between a blockchain-based representation of an asset (on-chain title) and the actual physical property represented. For example, if a hacker steals a tokenized deed to a house, court rulings can restore the token to the true owner.\n\n\nJTC came out of stealth mode in 2022. In February of 2023, the first case regarding JTC was decided live in a United States Federal District Court, making JTC the only blockchain ever to have complied with a court decision while maintaining full decentralization.\n\n\nJTC has a strong connection to the BTC blockchain. It incorporates the BTC blockchain ledger up to block height 717808, which occurred on January 8, 2022. All BTC wallets as of that block received JTC coins in a 1:1 ratio to their BTC holdings. This means that almost 90% of JTC is distributed to BTC holders, giving them stakes in both networks. Furthermore, JTC adheres to the same Bitcoin protocols prescribed by Satoshi Nakamoto, including proof-of-work consensus, anonymous accounts, self-custodied assets, and an immutable ledger.\n\n\nTo learn more about the technology behind JTC, you can read the Jurat Whitepaper at jurat.io/whitepaper/.\n\n\n## How many JTC are in circulation?\n \nJTC follows the same release schedule and halving schedule as BTC. As of May 2023, there are approximately 19.1 million JTC coins in circulation and the maximum supply is 21 million. Thus, less than 10% of JTC coins remain to be mined.\n\n\n## What makes JTC unique?\n \nJTC shares a common connection with BTC but adds unique features which provide robust  consumer protection and which are useful for mainstream commerce. \n\n\nRecovering digital assets in the event of crime or lost private keys:  JTC makes it possible for digital asset owners to enforce their legal rights by including native protocols for accessing  official courts. This capability is lacking in other cryptocurrencies. \n\n\nEnhancing versatility for commercial transactions: Businesses rely on the enforcement of legal rules and remedies to function. Usually these remedies are ordered by a court and executed through the traditional banking system, such as a chargeback for fraud. JTC’s unique ability to interact with the judicial system allows businesses to invoke these same remedies on a blockchain, without involving a financial intermediary or custodian. This opens business use cases for cryptocurrency and digital assets that have eluded other blockchains. \n\n\nDemocratizing the tokenization of real world assets:  With JTC, individuals and businesses can now easily create their own digital assets (JTC ordinals) equipped with the same powerful features as the JTC coin. JTC ordinals include the contractual agreements regarding the token, can respond to copyright protections, and can be used to enforce other applicable laws, all directly on-chain. This empowers individuals to create and custody their own digital assets while still retaining the ability to enforce the legal rights they have tokenized. In contrast, NFTs and BTC ordinals lack native court access, requiring the token owners to relinquish control to a third-party custodian, incurring costs and sacrificing privacy.\n \nReducing risk and adding value: \n\n\nJTC’s unique on-chain enforcement capabilities enhance digital asset values in several ways. First, the lack of effective law enforcement on traditional blockchains exposes property owners to theft and fraud risks, and these risks dissuade typical consumers and businesses from adopting cryptocurrency. When mainstream users are comfortable owning a digital asset, demand for that asset and its value increases. A second way JTC increases digital asset values is because criminals will stay away from a blockchain where they are subject to law enforcement. This is analogous to how home prices increase when effective policing reduces crime in a neighborhood.\n\n\nThird, JTC's technological advancement in upholding the rule of law on blockchains diminishes the grounds for governmental opposition to cryptocurrency. The risk of governmental prohibitions, as seen in the price action of cryptocurrencies following China's ban, highlights the universal impact of such regulatory threats on digital asset markets.\nFurther information about JTC’s unique legal compliance features can be found in Jurat’s formal comments submitted to the U.S. Treasury Department, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/comment/TREAS-DO-2022-0014-0220\n \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/comment/ITA-2022-0003-0043\n \n## Who are the founders of JTC?\n\n\nJTC is a branch of the Bitcoin blockchain, founded by Satoshi Nakamato, a genius inventor or team of inventors.  Nakamoto's Bitcoin Whitepaper presented a method to create a peer-to-peer digital currency called “bitcoin” that functions without the need for a financial intermediary. Many believe that bitcoin was invented in response to central banks misusing the power to print fiat money and diluting people's wealth during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\nThe person most closely associated with the creation of Jurat and the JTC fork of Bitcoin is Mike Kanovitz, a seasoned civil rights and consumer protection attorney. \n\n\nConcerned about victims of cryptocurrency crime who had lost their life’s savings to hacks and frauds, Mike built a specialized consumer protection practice at Loevy & Loevy, the 100-person civil rights law firm he co-founded. Unfortunately, the firm had difficulty helping many victims because blockchain operators were not providing users a method to enforce their legal rights, meaning most victims could not recover even after the firm proved their case in court. Worse, the mining industry had become dominated by a few major players who were complacent, failing to protect users from the criminal misuse of their blockchains. \n\n\nOver the course of two years, Loevy & Loevy attorneys set about changing this paradigm. They teamed up with blockchain engineers to reimagine how courts could interface with a decentralized network, and the Jurat project was born. Jurat Blockchains was founded to provide these solutions to the decentralized community. It launched the JTC blockchain in 2022.\n\n\nMr. Kanovitz received the 2023 Achievement Award in Innovation from the Government Blockchain Association for his leadership on decentralized legal enforcement. He speaks, publishes articles, and engages with government agencies on the topic of blockchain-based legal rights. He holds a Juris Doctor degree from Cornell University. Following graduation, he worked on behalf of whistleblowers and victims of police abuse. His cases have secured verdicts and settlements exceeding $500 million for people whose rights were violated. \n\n\nAdditional team members included Vadim, a veteran engineer with expertise in banking software and multiple patents in the blockchain space; Alexzandra, a serial entrepreneur and go-to-market expert; and Jon, a celebrated trial attorney highly respected by the federal judiciary.\n\n\n## How does JTC compare to older Bitcoin forks?\n\n\nMost Bitcoin forks developed due to a schism within the Bitcoin mining community over the operation of the blockchain. JTC is different from past forks in that it was developed through the collaborative efforts of a multidisciplinary team working to address a critical problem for blockchain’s future: the absence of legal enforcement in cryptocurrency transactions. Lack of enforcement makes coin owners susceptible to hacking, fraud, and the loss of private keys, which ultimately hampers the widespread acceptance and use of blockchain payment rails like Bitcoin.\n\n\nFurther, JTC has already been widely distributed to BTC addresses, so a majority of the community now holds stakes in both networks and can utilize each for its specific purposes. This eliminates needless competition with BTC. For instance, in a business deal where chargebacks may be crucial, companies can conduct transactions in JTC while still holding their BTC as an asset. By contrast, the projects that only seek to supplant BTC as the “true Bitcoin” add nothing of value to Satoshi Nakamoto’s work.  \n\n\nJTC also stands out among Bitcoin forks for its potential for distinctive growth. It provides users with the ability to tokenize enforceable legal rights, including property rights in real-world assets. Asset tokenization is a significant and upcoming use case for blockchain technology. JTC takes it a step further by enabling seamless integration with the legal system, enhancing the value and utility of asset tokenization.\n\n\nBeing the most recent Bitcoin fork, JTC also benefits from lessons learned in the last decade about the need for blockchains to work together with government officials. JTC is designed to provide important tools that meet the needs of legitimate government authorities while still upholding the values of decentralization and ensuring due process of law for everyone involved in decentralized communities.\n",

To do that RektSkulls implement an innovational approach to fundraising, instead of getting money from VCs or selling NFTs for ETH - funds are earned from ecosystem activity, from token tax mechanic.\r\n\r\nIt means that team will continuously support demand for the token and each NFT in the ecosystem by implementing new mechanics and utilities. No matter what type of NFT or token user holds within the ecosystem, there will always be different options how to spend or use it, and other strategies that user can choose to benefit as part of the RektSkulls project.\r\n\r\n## What is REKT token?\r\n\r\n* The native token is the key part of the RektSkulls ecosystem, every product, service, and mechanic within the ecosystem is paid by REKT token.\r\n* Has 2.5% tax mechanic on sell/buy/transfer transactions (except interaction with project mechanics, such as auctions). Tax mechanic is the only source of funding for project. \r\n* 95% of $REKT token is obtained from Essences and LP staking.\r\n* 5% reserved for future in-game economy bootstrap.\r\n* Has burn mechanics - all token from the winning bid of Genesis Skulls auctions are burned. Future mechanics also will include burning of REKT token.\r\n* Royalties from NFTs secondary market trading will be used to buyback and burn REKT token.\r\n\r\n## How are REKT tokens distributed?\r\n\r\n95% (95,000,000) of REKT tokens are distributed through staking over two years, with 20% rewards decrease every 3 month (“halving” mechanic). Staking of Essences (RektSkulls utility NFTs) and LP tokens started on Feb 1, 2023.\r\n5% (5,000,000) of REKT tokens are reserved for future in-game economy bootstrap.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Who is the founder of RektSkulls?\r\n\r\nDima Gladush - founder and artist. Switched to crypto full time in 2017 after almost a decade as white collar at state company, dealing with international trade operations. Joined daomaker.com in 2019 as graphic designer and eventually led their design department up until September 2022.\r\n\r\nDeFi enthusiats, in love with NFTs since early 2021. Self proclaimed pixel-artist.",

A metaverse is a virtual world where users can interact and engage in a wide range of activities, such as gaming, socializing, and buying and selling unique virtual assets.\r\n\r\nThe EXGOLAND metaverse will leverage the latest advancements in artificial intelligence to create immersive and highly interactive virtual environments. Users will be able to interact with AI-powered virtual characters, explore dynamic virtual worlds, and engage in a wide range of activities. The metaverse will also be fully decentralized, giving users greater control and ownership over their virtual experiences.\r\n\r\nIn addition to AI-powered virtual environments, EXGOLAND will also feature an NFT market. NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are unique digital assets that can be owned and traded, just like physical assets. NFTs have gained popularity in recent years due to their scarcity and uniqueness, and the EXGOLAND NFT market will allow users to buy, sell, and trade virtual assets such as virtual real estate, collectibles, and in-game items. These assets can have real-world value, adding a new level of immersion and ownership to virtual experiences.\r\n\r\nEXGOLAND is an exciting project that has the potential to revolutionize the virtual world. By combining the power of AI with the NFT market, EXGOLAND is creating a new type of metaverse that will offer users unprecedented levels of immersion, interaction, and ownership.

            "description": "What is sWAVES?\r\n\r\nsWaves protocol allows PepeTeam users to earn a passive income and participate in the protocol's governance. sWaves protocol is based on one of the core functionality of the Waves blockchain - Waves staking. The Waves blockchain users share their WAVES with the Waves nodes to increase nodes' chances to mine a block. In return, the nodes owners share a mining reward with users, sending the reward via transfer or mass-transfer transactions. Waves stakers have to stake received reward if they want to compound their income and increase APY. Sending mining rewards by node's owners and staking received rewards by stakers requires the payment of a transaction fee. These transaction costs reduces the Waves staking profitability. The PepeTeam found a way to minimize these costs and increase the WAVES staking APY.\r\n\r\nWAVES staking with the PepeTeam. How does it work?\r\n\r\nThe PepeTeam users can provide WAVES to the protocol’s contract and receive sWaves tokens in return. The contract stakes their WAVES to PepeTeam's own node. The reward received for mining is automatically staked to the same node, increasing the protocol's balance and, therefore, collateral of sWaves. A staker can unstake his WAVES and receive his deposit and income at any time. In short, user can exchange his sWaves tokens for Waves at the new rate.\r\nMoreover, PepeTeam gives Waves to sWaves stakers. We have our own Neutrino community node. An income received from its mining, we add to the sWaves node to increase sWaves token collateral and sWaves staking's APY. Can you believe it?! Nooo!? Just check our Neutrino node operations by yourself.\r\n\r\nBesides, sWAVES which were used to pay the transaction fee, will be exchanged for WAVES via sWAVES contract and part of them will be added to the sWAVES collateral.\r\nThe staking process works like this\r\n\r\n1. An investor deposits their WAVES tokens to a smart contract;\r\nthe smart contract stakes the token and issues sWAVES tokens to the user at the current exchange rate — rate1\r\n\r\n2. The investor begins to receive passive income.\r\n\r\n3. The investor can cancel the staking at any time by calling the smart contract’s withdraw function. Their sWAVES will be swapped back to WAVES at rate2, which will always be algorithmically higher than rate1, as new WAVES tokens will be added to the smart contract . Thanks to the difference between the rates, the user will collect a profit.",

            "description": "\"LendeXe is a Web3 ecosystem of various innovative DeFi applications.\r\n\r\nThe past has shown that Stablecoins are not really stable. This was mainly due to the fact that various Stablecoins were backed by volatile tokens. At the center of LendeXe’s vision is the XSD Stablecoin. This is the safest stablecoins in the market because it is backed by the three largest other Stablecoins: USDT, USDC, BUSD. Even if one of these Stablecoins were to implode for some unknown reason, there are safety mechanics designed for such unlikely cases.\r\n\r\nThat’s why Lendexe offers several ways to mint XSD Stablecoins in order to help preserve the value of one’s assets during a market downturn. In addition, XSD can be used as collateral for the Lendexe Decentralized Lending Protocol.\r\n\r\nAround the XSD Stablecoin, Lendexe has created a variety of products that allow anyone to secure their crypto assets or create passive income with them. From LendeXe Lending to the Ultimate Loan (a loan for 1.5x the value of your collateral).\"",

            "description": "## What is CigDAO?\r\n\r\n\r\nCrypto is Good DAO or CigDAO is a decentralized organization rooted in game theory and focused on accelerating the growth of the Internet Computer $ICP ecosystem. Your Coin ($YC) holders govern CigDAO canister smart contracts and treasury. CigDAO catalyzes growth through two core processes: \r\n\r\n#### Partner Funding:\r\n\r\nPartner grants have created several exciting partnerships with some fantastic projects in development today. Anyone is welcome to propose a partnership grant from CigDAO. Applicant proposals outline how they will use the grant funding to grow their dApp and provide value to the CigDAO ecosystem. \r\n\r\n#### Developer level tooling:\r\n\r\nThe CigDAO team developed “My Little Protocol (MLP). MLP is an open-sourced command line interface tool that enables dApp developers to tokenize and decentralize their entire application stack. MLP allows developers to focus on application development rather than the DAO technology by providing a token, DAO canister, swap canister, multi-sig wallet, token explorer, and proposal UI.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Tokenomics\r\n\r\nYour Coin ($YC) governs CigDAO. Your Coin is a novel token with a substantial tax system that encourages holding and ensures constant deflation. At the time of writing, every transfer of $YC is taxed 11%. The tax is distributed across to DAO treasury, team treasury, holders, and burn function at 3%, 2%, 3%, and 3%, respectively. These parameters are under the control of YC holders and can change with a DAO proposal. \r\n\r\nEvery one of Your Coins is equal to 1 DAO vote. DAO proposals are the only way to make code changes, transfer funds, etc. When $YC is used to vote, it is taxed at 100% according to the above percentages. If you cast ten votes, you relinquish ownership of all ten tokens. \r\n\r\nYC launched in December 2022 with 1,000,000,000,000 tokens. 100,000,000,000 tokens are held in a vesting smart contract, 200,000,000,000 tokens are held for initial liquidity, and 200,000,000,000 tokens are available for public sale. At the time of writing, 503,090,077,914 tokens have burnt.\r\n\r\n## Token Distribution\r\n\r\nThe novel approach to the YC token distribution is rooted in game theory. Distribution will take place over one year starting on 12/1/2022 at 4:00:00 PM. 200,000,000,000 of Your Tokens are in distribution according to the schedule below:\r\n\r\n200,000,000,000 of Your Tokens are split evenly into 365 consecutive 24-hour periods of 547,945,205.47945210 YC. At the end of each 24 hours, the respective set number of Your Tokens set forth above will be distributed pro rata amongst all purchasers, based on the total $ICP contributed during those periods, respectively, as follows: Number of Your Tokens distributed to a purchaser = a * (b/c)\r\n\r\na = Total $ICP contributed by a purchaser during the period.\r\nb = Total number of Your Tokens available for distribution in the period.\r\nc = Total $ICP contributed by all authorized purchasers during the period.\r\n\r\nAt the time of writing, 75/365 have ended, and 41,095,890,411 billion tokens distributed to participants members.\r\n\r\n### More information on CigDao\r\nhttps://blog.cigdao.com/\r\nhttps://cigdao.com\r\nhttps://dao.cigdao.com",

The integration of these segments into one entity allows the player to experience a completely new gaming experience.\r\nWhat makes your project unique?\r\nAn important part of the game is the implemented new and unique move-to-earn model, which is not based on an inflationary reward token. Players will earn items for their physical activity, which they will use to create potions with various bonuses. At lower levels, these potions will be non-NFT, but top-tier potions will be created as NFTs and therefore fully tradable on the market for real money. As the game will not allow players to directly replenish health or energy points for money, as is the case in classic games, but only through potions, this creates a balance between buyers and sellers. The game thus fully relinquishes profit, which the players will share among themselves. As these are \"consumables\" NFTs, their inflation will be low to zero, and the price will thus remain stable. All of these factors allow the creation of a true and fully functional move-to-earn model.\r\nHistory of your project.\r\nThe creators had the idea to create SpaceCatch mainly because they saw a significant gap in the area of games with modern technologies such as augmented reality (AR), blockchain, or NFTs. SpaceCatch therefore tries to connect these modern technologies together. The first ideas appeared in early 2022, and active development began in the fall of 2022.\r\nWhat’s next for your project?\r\nSpaceCatch follows the motto \"product first\". Nowadays, the trend is to release a token or NFTs first and then start developing the game, which can take several months or even years until investors and players get at least something. However, SpaceCatch does the opposite. Therefore, a demo will be released soon, followed by a beta version of the game within a few months, and then the full version of the game. Although the game is complex, a team of 30 people works on it full-time. High work efficiency and professionalism of the team enable the development to progress at a rapid pace.\r\nWhat can your token be used for?\r\nThe CATCH token is designed to serve as a premium currency in the SpaceCatch game. There will be many features in the game that will only be available for CATCH. The token will primarily serve as a value store for the players themselves. The tokenomics have also been adapted to this, with more than half of the total supply going into circulation immediately after the start, significantly reducing inflationary pressures. CATCH will not serve as an in-game reward token, and its only inflationary component will be staking, which is programmed for an initial period of five years with an annual halving.",

            "description": "## What Is EQD?\r\n\r\nEQD is a USD-pegged, Polkadot-native, decentralized, asset-backed stablecoin launched by Equilibrium (a DeFi hub of DotSama). EQD can be minted against a well-diversified portfolio of assets, thereby greatly reducing a borrower’s collateral risks. \r\n\r\nEQD is providing high leverage on underlying collateral and improving capital efficency in DeFi thanks to innovative financial engineering on the background.\r\n\r\n## The mechanics behind EQD\r\n\r\nEQD is a portfolio-collateral backed stablecoin, with a 1:1 peg to USD. Incentives, risk management, and balancing of supply-demand within Equilibrium’s stablecoin protocol contribute to the EQD value pegged to the dollar. In addition, Equilibrium’s on-chain risk management system [link: https://docs.equilibrium.io/under-the-hood/risk-modeling] and bailout mechanism ensure accurate derivation of the EQD value from set parameters. This results in a stablecoin that is always overcollateralized by liquid crypto-assets.\r\n\r\n## How Many EQD Are There in Circulation?\r\n\r\nEQD is backed by portfolio of assets that includes DOT, ETH, USDT, USDC, Dotsama native tokens, and others. As such, its maximum theoretical supply equals overall market cap of assets accepted as collateral times average collateralization ratio. \r\n\r\n## Who Are the Founders of EQD?\r\n\r\nAlex Melikhov is the founder and CEO of Equilibrium, the DeFi platform issuing EQD stablecoins. Alex is an engineer in applied mathematics by training. Before blockchain, he was working on fintech projects.\r\n\r\nEquilibrium’s team includes 27 team members who have been working together since 2017. The engineering team is highly experienced in building on various blockchain platforms, from Ethereum to EOSIO and the Substrate framework. \r\nNow the team is developing on Polkadot to obtain true cross-chain interoperability and to turn Equilibrium into a full-fledged DeFi one-stop shop.\r\n\r\n## Why is EQD unique?\r\n\r\nEQD is implementing a novel liquidation mechanism through insurance (vs. regular DeFi auctions) that makes it extremely resilient in case of market flactuations and allows for significant lowering collateral requirements. \r\nAs such, EQD can be a highly effective lending instrument for leveraging volatile assets users want to hold instead of selling for dollar liquidity. \r\n\r\n## What makes EQD secure?\r\n\r\nEQD’s competitive advantage lies in its built-in strong peg mechanism via three layers of protection: Layer 1: Overcollateralization requirement, Layer 2: Insurance Pool to secure debt positions, Layer 3: Stability fund, backed by Equilibrium Treasury, which acts as liquidity backstops. \r\n\r\n## EQD supports interoperable, multi-chain use cases\r\n\r\nEQD can be transferred seamlessly and securely via Cross-Chain Message Format (XCM) to other Polkadot parachains without the need for external bridges, thanks to Polkadot’s interoperability technology. \r\n\r\nEQD use cases, therefore, extend beyond Equilibrium through its extensive connections with other networks in the Polkadot ecosystem. In addition to EQD’s utility on Equilibrium as a quote currency for its orderbook DEX, EQD is adopted by other parachains as currency for various decentralized services fee payment, in-gaming transactions, as routing asset into other supported blockchains, and more.",

It is used to incentivize users and provide benefits to holders, while also acting as a governance mechanism. At the start of the platform, 10 million FS tokens are generated and will be gradually unlocked over a two-year period to ensure stability and promote long-term growth. \r\n$FS Token Utilities\r\nLiquidity Mining: The FS token also provides benefits to its holders in the form of rewards and staking opportunities. Holders of FS tokens can earn rewards through liquidity provision and staking. This incentivizes users to hold onto their FS tokens and provide liquidity to the platform, contributing to its overall stability and growth.\r\nGovernance: In terms of governance, holders of FS tokens are granted significant decision-making power within the Future Swap. They possess governance rights, including the ability to vote on proposals for improvement. The collective decision of FS holders will shape the future of the Future Swap protocol, determining key parameters and product features. This ensures that the platform is constantly evolving and improving to meet the needs of its users.\r\nProfit sharing: A portion of the fees collected from users of the Future Swap platform is reserved and placed in a reserve pool. This pool is collectively managed by the holders of FS tokens, giving them significant control over the platform's reserves. By having a say in the management of the reserve pool, FS holders play an active role in the stability and growth of the Future Swap ecosystem.\r\nIn summary, the FS tokenomic is a multifaceted system that serves multiple purposes within the Future Swap ecosystem. It incentivizes users to hold and use $FS and $FUSD, provides a governance mechanism for the platform and offers rewards and staking opportunities to holders. The FS token is a crucial component of the Future Swap ecosystem, helping to ensure its stability, growth, and success.\r\nOverall, the Future Swap protocol is a highly innovative solution for stablecoin trading. Its dynamic leverage mechanism and stablecoin invariant ensure the stability of the platform, while its tokenomic model provides traders with the incentives and benefits necessary to keep the platform thriving.

            "description": "Relative is a decentralized derivatives platform that provides market participants with exposure to the ‘relative’ strength between two assets through the creation of Relative Strength Derivatives (RSDs). RSDs provide participants with the ability to speculate on the difference in performance between two assets, rather than the absolute performance of a single asset. Relative’s unique offering is a suite of products that allow users to speculate on and profit off the relative price action of any two assets, simply by backing their favoured asset to outperform another within a given time frame.\r\n\r\nThe creation of RSDs unlocks a new paradigm for speculators and can greatly benefit the average market participant:\r\n\r\nAgnostic to Market Conditions: Potential for gains in a bearish or negative market environment where assets depreciate in value\r\n\r\nHedging Mechanism: Speculating on the ‘relative value’ of an asset is an effective hedge against an asset’s depreciation in fiat value\r\n\r\nSpeculate using Fundamentals: Identify and profit off market trends based on fundamental analysis of correlated assets - independent of macroeconomic conditions\r\n\r\nUnlock New Opportunities: RSDs greatly expand the ‘trading pairs’ available to speculators through the creation of custom pairs across multiple asset classes\r\n\r\nThe Relative Token (RLTV) will be integral to the Relative ecosystem:\r\n\r\n- Work Token: RLTV token holders locking the token in a staking contract have the ability to earn 50% of the fees generated from the trading of derivatives built on Relative. Fees are not limited to USDT or RLTV as fees in Relative's multi-chain model can be also collected from the native tokens of other layer-1 applications that RLTV is deployed on.\r\n\r\n- Governance Token: Decisions made towards the economics of the Relative ecosystem as well as the intricacies of the derivatives products are governed by the Relative DAO. This DAO uses the RLTV token as its governance token allowing for token holders to take a stance on proposals made in the ecosystem.",

DeFi users can benefit from the mid-term interest rate gap between stables and the rising treasury. TProtocol will provide a solution so that DeFi users will no longer be underpaid even in a cooling crypto market.\r\n\r\nTBT is a rebasing token that is fully backed by sTBT, a permissioned token issued by a multi-billion ceDeFi institution. sTBT is a rebasing token whose price is always $1 and is only available for high net worth individuals or institutions. TBT is permissionless and can be minted with USDC at a minting fee of 0.1%. The minting price of TBT is always $1, and users can redeem TBT for USDC with a redemption fee of 0.3%. TBT can be converted to wTBT, a non-rebasing token that allows TProtocol to be integrated into existing DeFi protocols that do not support rebasing tokens. TProtocol handles the daily operations including trading, liquidity management, and risk management, and charges fees to cover interest rate costs and protocol fees. The redemption process takes 4 business days, and it is recommended to obtain liquidity from the secondary market instead of redemption.",

MOTION’s mantra is to comprehensively solve the problems of existing centralized health and wellness systems. Today’s centralized health and wellness systems suffer from issues like the lack of secure, decentralized, and trustworthy electronic health data, Industry is also suffering from counterfeit and supply chain leaks for Sports & Fitness Supplements. MOTION would be focused to enhance the health and wellness of its users. MOTION will use blockchain, machine learning, and Non- Fungible Tokens to achieve this vision.\r\n\r\nToday, health data is controlled by a few industry intermediaries who collect, control and consume data through their wearables and mobile apps. MOTION wants to change this trend and empower\r\nits users to control their health data. For this, MOTION will use Blockchain because this transformational technology offers us a chance to bring back the control of the health data to the users. Blockchain can solve issues related to data ownership with its decentralized architecture. It will\r\nhelp restore health data control to the user by empowering them to determine who has access to their information online. It is a paradigm shift in how health data is dealt with. This will offer consumers much- needed control over their health data.",

Earth looks like it's minimized but able to express every single detail that exists on earth, even if it's very rough terrain. People can travel and see any cities, forests, lakes, and any other place in this world just by a single touch on the map in 3D. Just you thought this is enough, Versera Metaverse efficient opti- mization technology, you can experience and enjoy all of these without any lags! You do not need high-spec hardware to enjoy this world. There would be no other way to travel freely on this green earth as we do.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe native cryptographically-secure fungible protocol token of Versera Metaverse (VERAT) is a transferable representation of attributed utility functions specified in the protocol/code of Ver- sera, and which is designed to be used solely as an interoperable utility token thereon. VERAT Token is a functional multi-utility token which will be used as the medium of exchange between participants on VERSERA in a decen- tralised manner. The goal of introducing VERAT Token is to provide a convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement between participants who interact within the ecosystem on VERSERA Metaverse without any intermediaries such as centralized third-party entities/institutions/- credit. Further, VERAT Token provides the economic incentives which will be distributed to encourage users to exert efforts towards contribu- tion and participation in the ecosystem on VERSERA Metaverse, thereby creating a mutually beneficial system where every partici- pant is fairly compensated for its efforts. We will be issuing secured 2 billion VERAT Tokens which are similar to crypto coins. 1 billion VERAT Tokens have been issued and retained by the project, and allocated for interactions with user con- tent like creating digital assets and products.",
