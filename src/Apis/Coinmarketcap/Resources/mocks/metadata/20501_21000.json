We are the first\r\nproject to effectively bring this community feeling to web3 with a revolutionary Rate2Earn (R2E)\r\nconcept. \r\n\r\nWe use NFTs, SocialFi and token incentivization to engage users to give genuine reviews\r\nabout each place that they visit. We reward users for participating in the leisure economy.\r\n\r\nWe aim to leverage this and create a WhereAt Universe where people can benefit from each\r\nother's experiences.\r\n\r\nWhereAt’s mission is to leverage blockchain technology, GameFi and SocialFi to create a\r\ntransparent, fair and open review economy for both users and businesses.\r\nWe want to provide as much value to our ecosystem as possible. We believe that the web3 race is\r\nwon by those who survive, not by those who grow the fastest. We aim for long-term retention of\r\nusers and multiple steady revenue streams from parallel sources. Wherever possible, we will share\r\nour success with our users in a sustainable way to create a tightly-knit community. To allow for\r\nsteady positive player growth, we use an invite-only application and a built-in reward\r\nmechanism.\r\nYou can regard us as the Tripadvisor of web3. Eventually, we will pass what we call the “Normies\r\nTest”. This means that after developing and launching WhereAt into web3, we aim to have\r\nnon-web3 users install and use the application. The majority of blockchain games and\r\napplications (apps) are extremely technical and create barriers to adoption. We are proud to be a\r\nfamily-friendly brand that thrives on simplicity, straightforwardness, and positivity. People should\r\nfeel energized when using our application and feel like they belong to a friendly community. We\r\ndo not want to bring the occasional toxicity of web3 into our app, but rather bring the positivity of\r\nthe decentralized revolution to the review economy.",

            "description": "Fuel Network is a Modular Execution Layer for Ethereum. Fuel v1 started out as a scaling solution for Ethereum using the Optimistic Rollup (ORU) model for payment purposes. Fuel v1 works on the UTXO model that allows for faster transaction processing since transactions are validated in parallel on the user’s hardware.\n\nWhile Layer 2 has ushered in a reduced cost of accessing the Ethereum ecosystem, the scalability is rather modest (with both Optimistic Rollup & Zk Rollup). And in a time of high traffic on Ethereum, L2 has failed to keep costs low, often rising to several dollars per transaction.\n\nThis is because each rollup block eventually has to post data to Ethereum, which ties the fees of the L2 platforms to the Ethereum fees (Zk Rollup is more cost efficient because they only post Proof), so each Rollup platform can only expand Ethereum by a certain rate.\n\nFuel network proposes a different approach towards modularity, where the Executive Layer is separated from data availability and consensus (Data Availability & Consensus). This separation allows for specialization at the base layer, offering greater scalability potential.\n\n",

            "description": "## What is TRI Protocol (TRI)?\n\nTRI is a user-friendly protocol with the purpose to validate information, secure transactions, and license assets on DeFiance.app — the world's most advanced Web 3.0 builder, powered by social validators. The protocol incentivizes DeFinace.app users with TRI tokens for contributing to the network.\n\nThe utility of TRI is shared in three parts, in like manner of the prefix “tri” meaning three. This triangular relationship forms the core value of DeFiance.app, the hub for decentralized finance (DeFi).\n1. Validate information.\n2. Secure transactions.\n3. License assets.\n\n\n## What Makes DeFiance.app Unique? \n\nDeFiance.app is the world's most advanced Web 3.0 builder that provides endless possibilities for projects, investors, marketers, content creators, artists, and developers to network, build, and transact. DeFiance.app is powered by social validators, the DeFiants, who in turn get rewarded to uphold the platform.\n\nThe mission of DeFiance.app, powered by TRI Protocol, is to create a united front of utility and help bring it to the masses for both people and protocols.\n\nAs a Web 3.0 hub, DeFiance.app offers unparalleled services, customization, and promotional outreach. Owners can easily tailor their DeFiance page to fit the unique needs of their protocol and take advantage of the wide range of reputable utilities and partnered services available. DeFiance.app deals and distributes for DeFi. To showcase a team's achievements, engage with their community, or attract new backers, DeFiance.app is an ideal solution. With highly active users and cross-community engagement, DeFiance.app can expand protocols’ DeFi audience.\n\nAs DeFiance.app grows, so does the network security through TRI Protocol. DeFiants gain higher reputation by accumulating points. Points can be earned by empowering social campaigns, vetting protocols, and working as validators for peer-to-peer freelance market transactions facilitated through the network and presented on Capture.\n\n\n## What Makes Capture Unique?\n\nCapture is a blockchain explorer powered by DeFiance.app data validation through the TRI Protocol. Its ultimate purpose is to safeguard transparency and accuracy of information. \n\nCapture ensures that the data shown and validated on DeFiance.app is stored and captured on the blockchain, rather than being hidden on backend servers or unfiltered explorers. This improves the overall quality and validity of the information available on the platform, making it easier for users to make informed decisions. In addition, it promotes transparency as all information is public and accessible to everyone, allowing for greater accountability and trust for protocols, users and development of the ecosystem. \n\n\n### Where Can I Buy TRI Protocol (TRI)?\n\nYou will be able to purchase TRI on a decentralized exchange (DEX), centralized exchange (CEX), or directly on DeFianceSwap. DeFianceSwap is the DEX of DeFiance.app which is the first to allow a positive tax while incorporating security badges for vetted tokens. \n\nFiat on-off ramp functionality will be introduced, making it easier than ever for users to buy or sell cryptocurrencies directly from DeFiance.app. Users will also be able to easily purchase tokens of listed protocols on DeFiance.app.",

            "description": "Coorest introduces a new carbon standard and a platform based on blockchain technology to cut out the middleman allowing for easy and transparent access to carbon compensation.\r\nThe certified Coorest Carbon Standard focuses on newly planted trees (additionality) only and allows the onboarding of farmers and green projects globally enabling them to generate and monetize their carbon sequestration efforts. All projects are monitored via satellite data to warrant the continuity and transparency of carbon sequestration efforts.\r\nThe Coorest carbon ecosystem has four tokens; NFTrees, CO2 token ($CCO2), Proof of Carbon Compensation certificate (NFT), and a governance token ($CRST). Through the tokenization of trees, absorbed CO2 and the claim on carbon compensation, the problem of double counting of compensated carbon emissions is avoided. Via the Coorest platform, retail, companies, and institutions can easily compensate for their carbon footprint while having maximum transparency.\r\nCoorest introduces two types of NFTrees that are linked to either fruit-bearing or regular trees. Holders of these Coorest NFTrees, trees planted and owned by Coorest, accumulate CO2 tokens for generating PoCC certificates. Once the fruit-bearing trees are planted and mature enough to produce fruit, the NFTree holder has the right to that fruit’s profit, therefore, generating an additional yield. The combination of revenue through the sales of CO2 tokens and yield-bearing possibilities associated with a tree ensures voluntary markets continue to drive finance to catalyze and generate additional emission reductions and removals.",

For example, if you are spending $100.00 USD, you can expect to receive a tax credit value of $150.00 USD.\r\n\r\nSTEP THREE: Mint PTCs\r\nMint your PTCs by emailing your tax credit certificate, together with your ETH or SOL wallet address (future PTCs will deploy using BTC and other blockchain technologies).\r\n\r\nOne (1) PTC will be minted for each $1.00 USD of tax credit value you exchange, less applicable fees.",

            "description": "## What is OpenChat?\r\n\r\nOpenChat is a fully featured, decentralized chat application, running on the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/) blockchain. It has direct messages and private groups like WhatsApp and Signal, public groups like Telegram, and will soon have a major new capability called “communities” which are like Slack workspaces or Discord servers.\r\n\r\nIt is a responsive, progressive web application (PWA) which scales to take advantage of any screen size and integrates with devices in a similar way to native apps, including push notifications. You can find the full [development roadmap here](https://oc.app/roadmap).\r\n\r\nThe app is [open source](https://github.com/dfinity-lab/open-chat) and runs as a collection of [canister smart-contracts](https://oc.app/whitepaper?section=2-1). It is possible to see the code running on any canister at any time with a link back to the particular version in source control and to independently [verify this is true](https://oc.apphttps://oc.app/architecture?section=3).\r\n\r\nA canister is created for each user which holds their direct chat data, links to the groups they are members of, and also serves as a wallet allowing OpenChat users to hold and manage tokens. Each group (and soon “community”) is also implemented as its own canister. [This architecture](https://oc.app/architecture) will allow OpenChat to scale to 100s of millions of users.\r\n\r\nOpenChat users can send messages to each other containing tokens such as ICP and ckBTC and so can be used for global remittance.\r\n\r\nThe main point of difference between OpenChat and similar apps, is that it's governed as a DAO.\r\n\r\n## What is the CHAT token?\r\n\r\nOpenChat has an associated utility token called CHAT. \r\n\r\n- It can be staked as neurons (very similar to ICP neurons) allowing token holders to participate in the [governance of OpenChat](https://oc.app/blog/governance) by voting on SNS proposals, and by doing so, earn voting rewards. These rewards increase the longer the tokens are staked and so token holders are incentivised to act in the long term interests of OpenChat.\r\n- It can be used by OpenChat users to pay for Diamond membership and other premium features.\r\n- It can be used to reward contributions to the evolution or growth of the OpenChat service either through automated user rewards or by SNS proposal.\r\n\r\nCHAT has an initial supply of 100M tokens. 2.5% of the total supply is minted annually to reward neuron holders for participating in governance by voting on proposals. CHAT can be burned to reduce the supply. Over time as the revenue earned in CHAT tokens for premium features grows, it is anticipated the burn rate will meet or even exceed the minting rate allowing the CHAT supply to become stable or even deflationary.\r\n\r\n## What is the OpenChat SNS DAO?\r\n\r\nThe OpenChat DAO operates and steers the direction of OpenChat using an on-chain automated system called an [SNS](https://internetcomputer.org/sns). \r\n\r\nChanges to the OpenChat SNS DAO, which include the treasury of ICP and CHAT tokens, the various tokenomic parameters, and the OpenChat dapp itself, can only be made by the OpenChat SNS governance canister upon successful execution of proposals which are voted on by 10000s of CHAT neuron holders.\r\n\r\nThe OpenChat SNS DAO itself was created automatically upon adoption of [this proposal](https://dashboard.internetcomputer.org/proposal/109811) by the Internet Computer's automated governance systemm, the [NNS](https://internetcomputer.org/nns). It initiated a public swap event on the 3rd of March 2023 when 2,375 participants deposited a total of 1M ICP tokens to the SNS in exchange for 25M CHAT tokens. When the swap concluded the OpenChat SNS DAO became active.\r\n\r\nThe initial CHAT token distribution was as follows:\r\n\r\n- 52%: Reserved for the SNS treasury & under control of the OpenChat DAO\r\n- 25%: Distributed to the public by the NNS run swap event\r\n- 15%: Allocated to the OpenChat dev team which vests over 4 years\r\n- 8%: Allocated to DFINITY for providing seed funding which vests over 2 years\r\n\r\nA small proportion of the treasury has been transferred (by proposal) to liquidity pools on various decentralized exchanges leaving the large majority to fund on-going development and other contributions, and to algorithmically reward OpenChat users. By rewarding 100,000s of engaged users with CHAT tokens and neurons the aspiration is to create a huge team of advocates incentivised by the success of OpenChat.\r\n\r\n## Who are the founders of OpenChat?\r\n\r\nOpenChat was founded by 3 software developers Matt Grogan, Hamish Peebles and Julian Jelfs. They originally met and worked together for several years building a platform for online travel agencies.\r\n\r\nMeeting in the 1990s Matt worked for many years with the founder and Chief Scientist of [DFINITY](https://dfinity.org/), Dominic Williams, on various software ventures. In 2020 Dom asked Matt if he would like to build apps on the Internet Computer. In turn Matt asked Hamish and Julian to form a team and OpenChat was born.\r\n\r\nMatt has been a software developer for nearly 30 years in a wide range of industries and tech stacks generally involving web technologies. He holds a masters degree in Engineering and Computer Science from the University of Oxford.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating with a masters degree in Mathematics from Cambridge University, Hamish transitioned into the world of software engineering where he focused primarily on high throughput, low latency cloud based systems.\r\n\r\nJulian has been dabbling in software engineering for the last 25 years or so. He has a varied industry background from defence to risk management, from e-commerce to education technology and from travel to chat. He has developed a penchant for functional front ends. He holds a masters degree in Politics, Philosophy & Economics from the University of Oxford.\r\n\r\n## Where can I buy the CHAT token?\r\n\r\nAt the time of writing you can buy CHAT tokens with ICP on various Decentralised Exchanges (DEXes).\r\n[ICDex](https://avjzx-pyaaa-aaaaj-aadmq-cai.raw.ic0.app/ICDex/CHAT/ICP)\r\n[ICPSwap](https://info.icpswap.com/swap/pool/details/ne2vj-6yaaa-aaaag-qb3ia-cai)\r\n[InfinitySwap](https://app.infinityswap.one/tokens/2ouva-viaaa-aaaaq-aaamq-cai)\r\n\r\nSupport is coming for the [Rosetta API](https://www.rosetta-api.org/) allowing easy integration to Centralised Exchanges (CEXes) at which point it is likely CHAT will be available to trade on CEXes for ICP or USDT.",

We’re natively based on the Aptos & Sui Chain, which is an extraordinarily swift, and inexpensive platform. Typically transactions cost a few cents and only take a couple of seconds to complete. At Fenture Finance, we believe strongly that cross-chain functionality is the key to unlocking the full potential of the blockchain and we’re working to expand our offering across to other chains.\r\n\r\nFenture Finance is a decentralized autonomous organization controlled by its governance token, FFD (Fenture Finance Dao). To participate in the DAO, users need to buy FFD tokens from the open market. These tokens can be used to vote on protocol proposals and direct the future of the project. They can also be staked in a revenue sharing contract to benefit from the treasury performance.",

RBX is how the value of the RB Protocol and shareholder trust in its ability to maintain RB close to peg is measured During epoch expansions the protocol mints RB and distributes it proportionally to all RBX holders who have staked their tokens in the Boardroom\r\n\r\nRB Finance is a Multi token accelerated ASC (Algorithmic Stable Coin) protocol on the Arbitrum blockchain, derived from Based Finance on Fantom. We are excited to be the the first-ever Tomb Fork project, pegged to the value of the $ARB token.\r\n\r\nAs dedicated Arbinauts, our mission was to bring new utility to the recently airdropped $ARB tokens. We have achieved this by introducing Genesis, a platform where users can farm $RB tokens using their $ARB. RB Finance is also the premiere Tomb Fork pegged to $ARB, offering added utility to Camelot Dex by providing liquidity on it and featuring and its $Grail as a genesis token.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that Curve 2pool and Tricrypto pool receipts can be deposited to earn additional rewards in RB Finance\r\n\r\nOur team comprises five experienced professionals in the crypto and DeFi space, actively participating in various protocols on Polygon, BSC, and Ftm. We are embarking on our first project on the Arbitrum blockchain, eager to contribute further to the community.\r\n\r\nOne common issue with various Tomb Forks is their short lifespan due to the limited utility of peg tokens. Our goal is to extend the value of our RB token by incorporating it into new protocols, thereby enhancing the overall ecosystem.\r\n\r\nRB Finance offers Liquidity Providers the opportunity to earn RBX, which serves as both a share token and governance token for our platform. which serves asboth a share token and governance token for our platform. Users can stake RBX in our Boardroom to earn additional RB with each epoch. RBX holders will have voting rights (governance) on proposals to improve the protocol and future use cases within the RB Protocol.",

Easy accessibility to a large player base:\r\nGames that are easy to play and basic will attract more players due to their simplicity. This will easily attract more users to use Core DAO network and facilitate the process of mass adoption.\r\n\r\n2.

Playing games to earn money and save time is a great idea because people can still spend more time with their family, and friends, and work in their daily lives.\r\n\r\n3. Reviving legendary games:\r\nCoreDoge wants to create a multi-GameFi platform to revive legendary games. This will attract fans of web2 games from the past of those games to participate in web3 and join into Core DAO ecosystem.\r\n\r\nHere is our whitepaper (lite version):\r\nhttps://coredoge.gitbook.io/coredoge-whitepaper/coredoge-a-multi-gamefi-platform-for-coredao-enthusiasts/abstract",

While ordinary users may enjoy the safe income generated by the Platform without understanding the details of the underlying finance systems, expert users may choose and mix strategies to compose one’s income portfolio, which we call “CREPE Cake.” They can publish the “CREPE Cake” in the form of a non-fungible asset and trade it in any open market. If other users buy and choose the Cake as their investment portfolio, the Cake creator could earn additional compensation.",

With BOX, players can engage in various activities and earn rewards within the Boxy World.\r\n\r\nStaking\r\nUsers can stake their BOX tokens on their virtual lands or through decentralized exchanges (DEXs) to earn additional BOX rewards. By staking their BOX, players can increase the security of their assets and earn passive income while participating in the Boxy World.\r\n\r\nGovernance\r\nAs a utility token, BOX also grants holders the ability to participate in the governance of the Boxy World. Players who hold and stake BOX can have a say in the decision-making process of the game's development, including proposals, voting on upgrades, and shaping the future direction of the Boxy World.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Many BOX Coins Are There in Circulation?\r\n\r\nThe total supply of BOX tokens is fixed at 85 million.

Of those taxes, 4% are redistributed to all token\r\nholders in BUSD in order to provide passive income. Also, 2% of\r\nsells go to our Unlock the Vault events where periodic burns and\r\ndistributions to token holders will take place. The remaining 3%\r\nensures the survival of the project, covering areas such as\r\nmarketing, technology and utility development, liquidity, and the\r\nstrategic buyback and burn feature.\r\nAll private and presale investors were not vested, but currently\r\nthere is a anti-dump mechanism in place. In addition, 100 trillion\r\ntokens had been allocated to our Diamond Hands Heist - a holder\r\nbonus airdrop for private, presale, and first-10-days investors that\r\nhold 100% of their tokens until 60 days past launch. A second\r\nHeist will distribute the rewards that have accumulated at 120\r\ndays past launch.",

            "description": "## What Is MASK?\n\nMASK is a potential Metamask token that has been teased by Consensys CEO Joe Lubin. However, MASK has not been launched yet. It remains unclear when exactly a potential MASK token could be launched. On March 28, 2023, the official MetaMask Twitter account [tweeted](https://twitter.com/MetaMask/status/1640763000947703833):\n\n“There are quite a few false rumors going around about a MetaMask snapshot/airdrop/etc. on March 31.\n\nThese rumors are not only false, but they are dangerous. They create opportunities for scammers and phishers.”\n\nOn 16 March 2022, Joe Lubin, co-founder of ConsenSys, told Decrypt that MetaMask planned to undergo 'progressive decentralization' and [introduce a token in the future](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/consensys-lubin-confirms-metamask-token-094034849.html). This announcement followed ConsenSys' $450 million Series D funding round, which raised the company's valuation to $7 billion. The confirmation put an end to speculation sparked by [Joe Lubin's initial teaser 'Wen $MASK' tweet in November 2021](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/consensys-founder-joe-lubin-teases-010302801.html#:~:text=joseph%20lubin%2C%20founder%20of%20ethereum%20incubator%20consensys%2C%20set%20off%20speculation%20a%20token%20for%20the%20non-custodial%20wallet%20metamask%20is%20imminent%20after%20tweeting%2C%20%E2%80%9Cwen%20%24mask%3F%20stay%20tuned.%E2%80%9D), where he tweeted: “Wen $MASK? Stay tuned.” \n\nAs part of the strategy, MetaMask plans to launch a DAO. However, Lubin clarified that it will not govern MetaMask but rather facilitate the funding of new MetaMask components.\n\nLubin's disclosure echoes comments made by Jacobc.eth, then MetaMask's Operations Lead (and current strategic advisor), during the ETHDenver conference in March 2022. Jacobc.eth emphasized Metamask's deep belief in progressive decentralization, stating that it should be implemented over time in a methodical manner that does not resemble a 'cash grab'.\n\nIn the [video interview](https://decrypt.co/videos/interviews/36VlhQa1/metamasks-jacobceth-at-ethdenver-2022), Jacobc.eth spoke of Metamask's aspirations to become 'community owned', and that 'a token [was] going to be an important aspect of that'.\n\n'When [Metamask] do[es] something like that, we are going to do it right and do it in a way that is really empowering to the community'.\n\nNotably, Jacobc.eth's use of 'when' -- rather than 'if' -- reinforces the inevitability of a MetaMask token at some point in the future.\n\n\n## **When will MASK be issued?**\n\nJacobc.eth said in the past that a MASK token would not be rushed. He told [Decrypt](https://decrypt.co/94040/ethereum-wallet-metamask-token-launch-wont-be-cash-grab):\n\n\"It's not something that we're going to wing and it's also not something where we're going to put our project in jeopardy of either regulators or give governance to 'airdrop farmers' or something like that.”\n\nDuring a [Fireside Chat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRg9s3-y_d0&ab_channel=ETHDenver) at ETH Denver 2023, Lubin reiterated that ConsenSys is actively working to decentralize MetaMask.  \n\nBeyond what has been said by ConsenSys CEO Joe Lubin and Jacobc (then MetaMask Ops Lead, and current advisor), there are no further details at the moment. In the interim, users should remain vigilant of [fake MetaMask phishing sites/campaigns](https://decrypt.co/95039/metamask-consensys-30-million-users#:~:text=lubin%20did%20not%20provide%20further%20details%20about%20the%20dao%20or%20a%20date%20for%20its%20launch%2C%20but%20did%20confirm%20that%20metamask%20is%20intending%20to%20launch%20a%20token.) and check [official MetaMask resources](https://metamask.io/) for further updates.",
